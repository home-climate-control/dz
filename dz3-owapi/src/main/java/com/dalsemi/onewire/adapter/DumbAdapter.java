/**
 * <p>
 * This {@code DSPortAdapter} class was designed to be used for the iB-IDE's
 * emulator. The {@code DumbAdapter} allows programmers to add and remove
 * {@code OneWireContainer} objects that will be found in its search. The Java
 * iButton emulator works by creating a class that subclasses all of
 * {@code OneWireContainer16}'s relevant methods and redirecting them to the
 * emulation code. That object is then added to this class's list of
 * {@code OneWireContainer}s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that methods such as {@code selectPort} and {@code beginExclusive} by
 * default do nothing. This class is mainly meant for debugging using an
 * emulated iButton. It will do a poor job of debugging any multi-threading,
 * port-sharing issues.
