/**
 * A <code>OneWireContainer</code> encapsulates the <code>DSPortAdapter</code>,
 * the 1-Wire&#174 network address, and methods to manipulate a specific 1-Wire device. A
 * 1-Wire device may be in the form of a stainless steel armored can, called an iButton&#174,
 * or in standard IC plastic packaging.
 *
 * <p>General 1-Wire device container class with basic communication functions.
 * This class should only be used if a device specific class is not available
 * or known.  Most <code>OneWireContainer</code> classes will extend this basic class.
 *

 * are returned from the {@link #getMemoryBanks() getMemoryBanks} method. See the
 * usage example below. </P>
