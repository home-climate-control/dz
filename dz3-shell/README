INSTRUMENTATION

Run this to start graphing the data stream produced by your 1-Wire network
and entities defined in ./conf/core-instrumentation.xml (adjust sensor
addresses to produce meaningful output):

	./dz-runner core-instrumentation.xml

Run this to start JMX instrumentation for the above:

	./dz-jconsole

Run this to produce PNG graphs for your RRD database content (look in
./rrd/html):

	./dz_graph_temperature.v2
