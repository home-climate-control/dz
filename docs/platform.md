## Current Development Tree

No clear answer other than "it runs on UNIX", it is quite possible that HCC will work on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and up, but it hasn't been tested yet.

It definitely works in a Docker container.

Stay tuned, more to come. Meanwhile, see [Build](./build/index.md).

## Legacy
The [legacy branch](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/tree/last-imperative-maintenance) effortlessly works on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
