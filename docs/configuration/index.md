Home Climate Control: Configuration
==
The configuration used by this branch is still XML based, and overcomplicated. Unless you already know how to put it together, you are better off getting the [gh47](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/tree/gh47) branch which uses a vastly simplified and, even better, documented YAML based configuration.
