## Caveat Emptor

Zigbee devices are not created equal. Take a close look at their APIs before you buy. Devices of the same class may have drastically different capabilities and behavior.

It would be a good idea to take a look at [Zigbee2MQTT Supported Devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/) database before buying a device.

## Prerequisites

* Working [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) installation.

## Recommended

* [Sonoff SNZB-02](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/SNZB-02_EFEKTA.html) - excellent battery life even when configured for short poll interval
* [SONOFF ZBDongle-E](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/ZBDongle-E.html) - two options are known, both work.

## Tested

These are simply known to work, with neither positive nor negative comments.

* [Sengled E1C-NB7](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/E1C-NB7.html#sengled-e1c-nb7) - metering outlet
* [Sonoff S31ZB](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/S31ZB.html#sonoff-s31zb) - non-metering outlet
