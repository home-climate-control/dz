One advantage all these sensors have is a very fast polling rate compared to other protocols. Normally, you wouldn't need that, but if you are using HCC to control equipment cooling, this might come handy.

All tested extensively:

* [AM2320](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3721)
* [BH1750](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bh1750-ambient-light-sensor/overview)
* [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/)
* [BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/) - probably overkill for this application
* [HTU21D-F](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1899)
* [SCD40](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD40/), [SCD41](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD41) - current choice because the right combination of sensors
