Home Climate Control: v4.2.0. Release Notes
==

Release focus: project structure.

Bugfixes and enhancements:
* [#304 Simplified project layout](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/issues/304)
* [#303 Single invalid Zigbee2MQTT no longer causes a cascading failure](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/issues/303)
* [#300 Ported the raise() logic from imperative to reactive code](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/issues/300)

## Stragglers
Same as [v4.0.0](./v4.0.0.md) - now being worked on.

## But doesn't this bleeding edge bleed too much?
Not anymore. The code base has proved stable enough to be depended upon.

Still, the long in the tooth, but rock stable code base is still available at [last-imperative-maintenance](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/tree/last-imperative-maintenance) branch, and will be mentioned in release notes until [all the stragglers](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/labels/reactive-straggler) are fixed.
