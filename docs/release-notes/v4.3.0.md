Home Climate Control: v4.3.0. Release Notes - DRAFT
==

Release focus: [Economizer and Scheduler integration](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/milestone/18).

### System Wide Measurement Units Support

Not even quarter of a century later, [Fahrenheit degrees are supported](../configuration/home-climate-control.md#measurement-units).

### Economizer Configuration
The [economizer](../configuration/zones.md#economizer) section of the configuration looks a bit different now.

Old syntax:
```yaml
economizer:
  ambient-sensor: *ambient-patio-temperature
  changeover-delta: 1
  target-temperature: 22
  keep-hvac-on: true
  controller:
    p: 1
    i: 0.0000008
    limit: 0.7
  mode: cooling
  hvac-device: *hvac-a6
```

New syntax (note the user changeable settings moving into their own `settings` section):
```yaml
economizer:
  ambient-sensor: *ambient-patio-temperature
  controller:
    p: 1
    i: 0.0000008
    limit: 0.7
  mode: cooling
  hvac-device: *hvac-a6
  settings:
    changeover-delta: 1
    target-temperature: 22
    keep-hvac-on: true
```

Also, the `settings` section is now optional (see [#267](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz/issues/267)). If the configuration file is not updated,
the economizer will be considered disabled, and a warning message will be logged at startup.
